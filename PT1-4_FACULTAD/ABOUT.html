  <div class="green">Elden Ring is an action role-playing game played in a third-person perspective with gameplay focusing
  on combat and exploration; it features elements similar to those found in other games developed by FromSoftware, such as
  the Souls series, Bloodborne, and Sekiro.In the Lands Between ruled by Queen Marika the Eternal, the Elden Ring, the source
  of the Erdtree, has been shattered. Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring known as the
  Great Runes, and the mad taint of their newfound strength triggered a war: The Shattering. The real Elden Ring is so much
  like Dark Souls at times that it feels distracting: there's a woman who levels you up, there's a throne to usurp, and many
  of the same types of monsters you find in Souls games, including some that are almost entirely identical.</div>
